Hi, my name is Varun Gopal and welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## 🔍 About Me

I am a graduate student in chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. My research work is at the intersection of computational chemistry and machine learning. Curently, I am studying the behavior of small molecules, proteins, and enzymes using molecular dynamics simulations. Recently, I have been exploring the applications of machine learning in this area - such as through machine learning interatomic potentials.
